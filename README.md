Hey, I’m Tommykins27 :)

I've been coding in python for around 6 years now from basic programs to more complicated projects.
My main intrests in CS are cybersecurity and machine learning although i am always happy to talk to anyone about anything :)

Im currently exploring ADT's and churning out as many as I can (some silly, some sensible). The aim is to replace all primitive data types in python with more... esoteric ones, and then writing a full program using all of them.

Feel free to request that i make something - it will hopefully make me less bored :smile:

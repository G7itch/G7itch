Heyyyyyy, I’m tommy :)
I've been coding in python for around 6 years now from basic programs to more complicated projects.
My main intrests in CS are cybersecurity and machine learning although i am always happy to talk to anyone about anything :)
Im currently trying to learn R and am working on my ternary (3 bit) computer emulation project as well as exploring ideas for making a graph based esolang.
